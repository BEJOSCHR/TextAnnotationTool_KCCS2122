# TextAnnotationTool

## Description
This is my first Vue project which i created for the KCCS lecture on the BUW in 2021/22
The goal is to give an annotater a tool to check, rewrite and submit labels which where predicted by an AI and had to be chacked now.

## Feature
The focus of this project was to be able to detect and edit wrong assigned labels, so i find out that it was realy difficult to find specific sentences to check.
This is why i focused a lot of effort on a good filter system, so you can sort out as much as you want.
Then I tried to keep the changing itself as simple and easy as possible and finaly you should be able to export your work.

## Problem
My only problem is the performance of my project... with huge datasets its taking some time to apply the filters, but after you filtered its working fine.
This is probably because i have no experience in Vue or webdevelopment in genreal so i dont know how to improve that part of the project
