# TextAnnotationTool

## Description
This is my first Vue project which i created for the KCCS lecture on the BUW in 2021/22
The goal is to give an annotater a tool to check, rewrite and submit labels which where predicted by an AI and had to be checked now.
This data could then be used for improving the AI by using it as new training data.

## Motivation
The whole project was based around creating a practicel tool, so that it could actualy be used for training an AI by filtering wrong results and flatten out the work which has to be done for training.

## Feature
The focus of this project was to be able to detect and edit wrong assigned labels, so i find out that it was realy difficult to find specific sentences to check.
This is why i focused a lot of effort on a good filter system, so you can sort out as much as you want.
Then I tried to keep the changing itself as simple and easy as possible and finaly you should be able to export your work.

## Problem
My only problem is the performance of my project... with huge datasets its taking some time to apply the filters, but after you filtered its working fine.
This is probably because i have no experience in Vue or webdevelopment in genreal so i dont know how to improve that part of the project

## Installation
There is not much to say... its a Webstorm Workspace using default Vue with nothing installed extra, so you should be able to clone it and use it as your one workspace in Webstorm. I used version 2021.2.3 of Webstorm.

## Results
The results i got from asking some friend about my project were pretty much all positve. Mostly performance problems and small issues which were partly fixed already.
So i would say that its a functional tool and im happy with the end result. If there was more time i probably would have added a better data import system because changing the json file manuell is not pretty good to be honest.
